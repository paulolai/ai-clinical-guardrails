        The user wants me to extract structured clinical information from a transcript
        and return it as JSON.\n\nTranscript:\n\"Patient started on Lisinopril 10mg
        daily for hypertension.\nAlso taking Metformin 500mg twice daily for diabetes.\"\n\nReference
        Date: 2026-02-22\n\nLet me analyze what I can extract:\n\n1. **patient_name**:
        Not mentioned - null\n2. **patient_age**: Not mentioned - null\n3. **visit_type**:
        Not explicitly stated, but \"started on\" suggests a prescription/follow-up
        visit. Since it''s not clear, I''ll put null or make a best guess. Given the
        context of starting medications, it could be \"follow-up\" or \"routine-check\".
        I''ll go with null since it''s not explicitly stated.\n4. **confidence**:
        Overall confidence - probably around 0.8 since medication info is clear but
        visit context is missing\n5. **extraction_notes**: Should note that patient
        demographics and visit type not specified, but medications and indications
        are clear\n\n**Medications**:\n1. Lisinopril 10mg daily\n   - name: Lisinopril\n   -
        dosage: 10mg\n   - frequency: daily\n   - route: null (not specified, assumed
        oral)\n   - status: started (explicitly stated \"started on\")\n   - confidence:
        0.95\n   - raw_text: \"Lisinopril 10mg daily\"\n\n2. Metformin 500mg twice
        daily\n   - name: Metformin\n   - dosage: 500mg\n   - frequency: twice daily\n   -
        route: null (not specified, assumed oral)\n   - status: continued (implied
        by \"Also taking\" - suggests ongoing, not new, but could be started too...
        actually looking at context: \"Also taking\" suggests this is current medication,
        while Lisinopril is new. But \"Patient started on... Also taking\" could mean
        both are new, or the Metformin is existing. Given the ambiguity, I''ll mark
        as \"unknown\" or \"continued\". Actually, \"Also taking\" usually implies
        in addition to the first medication, but doesn''t specify if it''s new or
        continuing. Given \"Patient started on\" applies to Lisinopril, and Metformin
        is mentioned separately with \"Also taking\", it''s likely Metformin was already
        being taken. But to be safe, I''ll mark status as \"unknown\" or interpret
        as \"continued\". \n   - Actually, looking carefully: \"Patient started on
        Lisinopril... Also taking Metformin...\" - this suggests Metformin is current
        medication. So status: \"continued\"\n   - confidence: 0.85 (slight ambiguity
        about whether this is also new or continuing)\n   - raw_text: \"Metformin
        500mg twice daily\"\n\n**Diagnoses**:\n1. Hypertension (indicated as reason
        for Lisinopril)\n   - condition: Hypertension\n   - icd10_code: I10 (Essential
        hypertension) - or null if not sure, but I10 is standard\n   - confidence:
        0.9\n   - raw_text: \"hypertension\"\n\n2. Diabetes (indicated as reason for
        Metformin)\n   - condition: Diabetes\n   - icd10_code: E11 (Type 2 diabetes
        mellitus) - Metformin is typically for Type 2, but could be other types. Better
        to be conservative and use E11 or leave null, or just put \"Diabetes\"\n   -
        confidence: 0.8 (since type not specified)\n   - raw_text: \"diabetes\"\n\n**Temporal_expressions**:
        None specific in the text (no dates or times mentioned except the reference
        date which is metadata)\n\n**Vital_signs**: None mentioned\n\n**Procedures**:
        None mentioned\n\n**Protocol_triggers**: None mentioned\n\n**Follow_up**:
        None mentioned\n\n**Additional_context**: None\n\nWait, I should check if
        \"daily\" and \"twice daily\" count as temporal expressions. They are frequencies
        rather than temporal expressions pointing to specific times, but they could
        be interpreted as such. However, they are better captured in the medication
        frequency field.\n\nLet me reconsider the visit_type. \"Patient started on\"
        suggests this is a visit where a new medication was prescribed. This could
        be \"follow-up\" or \"routine-check\". Given the limited information, null
        is safest, or I could say \"routine-check\" with low confidence. I''ll go
        with null to avoid hallucination.\n\nConfidence scores:\n- Medications: High
        confidence (0.9-0.95) because clearly stated\n- Diagnoses: High confidence
        (0.8-0.9) because indicated as indications for meds\n- Overall: Maybe 0.85\n\nICD-10
        codes:\n- Hypertension: I10\n- Diabetes: E11.9 (unspecified type) or just
        E11. Since Metformin is used for Type 2, E11 is reasonable, but could be other
        types. I''ll use E11.9 to be safe, or just provide E11.\n\nActually, looking
        at the guidelines: \"Do not hallucinate information not in the transcript\".
        So for ICD-10, I should either provide the code if I''m confident (Hypertension
        = I10 is pretty safe) or leave null. For diabetes, since type isn''t specified,
        I could leave null or provide E11 (since Metformin implies Type 2 usually,
        but not always).\n\nLet me structure the JSON properly.\n\nOne thing: The
        transcript mentions \"Patient started on\" - this implies the patient is the
        subject. But no name or age is given.\n\nRaw text extraction must be exact.
        So for Lisinopril, the raw text should probably be \"Lisinopril 10mg daily\"
        or the full phrase \"Patient started on Lisinopril 10mg daily for hypertension\"
        - but the example suggests specific parts. Looking at the schema, raw_text
        is \"exact text from transcript\", so I should capture the relevant portion.\n\nActually,
        for medications:\n- raw_text: \"Lisinopril 10mg daily\" (this is the specific
        part describing the med)\nBut could also include the context: \"Patient started
        on Lisinopril 10mg daily\"\n\nSimilarly for Metformin: \"Metformin 500mg twice
        daily\" or \"Also taking Metformin 500mg twice daily\"\n\nI''ll use the specific
        medication phrases.\n\nFor diagnoses:\n- raw_text: \"hypertension\" and \"diabetes\"\n\nCheck:
        Are there any temporal expressions? The reference date is 2026-02-22, but
        that''s metadata, not in the transcript. The transcript doesn''t contain temporal
        expressions like \"today\", \"yesterday\", etc.\n\nSo temporal_expressions
        should be an empty array [].\n\nVital signs: empty array []\nProcedures: empty
        array []\nProtocol_triggers: empty array [] or omitted? The schema shows it
        as an array, so empty array.\n\nFollow_up: null\nAdditional_context: null
        or empty string? The schema shows string, so null or \"\". I''ll use null.\n\nOne
        final check: The status for Metformin. \"Also taking\" suggests this is a
        current medication the patient is on, while Lisinopril is new. So:\n- Lisinopril:
        status \"started\"\n- Metformin: status \"continued\"\n\nThis seems most accurate.\n\nConfidence
        for Metformin status might be slightly lower (0.8) since \"also taking\" is
        slightly ambiguous (could mean \"also started taking\" but that''s less likely).\n\nRoute:
        Not specified, so null (not \"oral\" since that would be inference, though
        reasonable, guidelines say don''t hallucinate).\n\nDosage: \"10mg\" and \"500mg\"
        - clear.\nFrequency: \"daily\" and \"twice daily\" - clear.\n\nJSON structure
        check:\n- All keys present\n- Proper nesting\n- Confidence values as numbers
        (floats)\n- Arrays for empty lists\n\nLet me write the JSON. ","reasoning_content":"
