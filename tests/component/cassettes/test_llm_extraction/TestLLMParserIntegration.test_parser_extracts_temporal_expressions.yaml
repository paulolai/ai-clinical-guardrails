        The user wants me to extract structured clinical data from a short transcript.
        Let me analyze the input:\n\nTranscript: \"Patient was seen yesterday and
        will return in two weeks.\"\nReference Date: 2024-01-15\n\nKey observations:\n1.
        Patient name: Not mentioned - null\n2. Patient age: Not mentioned - null\n3.
        Visit type: \"was seen yesterday\" suggests a follow-up or recent visit, but
        it''s ambiguous. Could be follow-up since they''re returning. \"will return
        in two weeks\" suggests this is planning for future. Actually, the current
        context seems to be today (reference date 2024-01-15), and patient was seen
        yesterday (2024-01-14), and will return in two weeks (2024-01-29). This sounds
        like a follow-up visit plan.\n4. Temporal expressions:\n   - \"yesterday\"
        = 2024-01-14 (reference date 2024-01-15)\n   - \"two weeks\" from reference
        date = 2024-01-29 or from yesterday? Likely from now or from the visit, but
        ambiguous.\n5. No medications mentioned\n6. No diagnoses mentioned\n7. No
        vital signs mentioned\n8. No procedures mentioned\n9. No protocol triggers
        mentioned\n10. Follow up: \"will return in two weeks\" - this is the follow
        up instruction\n\nVisit type classification:\n- follow-up: Patient was seen
        and is returning - this fits\n- acute-complaint: Not indicated\n- routine-check:
        Not specifically indicated\n- post-operative: Not mentioned\n- well-child-check:
        Not indicated\n- urgent-same-day: Not indicated\n\nConfidence should be moderate
        for visit_type since it''s inferred from context rather than explicitly stated.\n\nTemporal
        expressions:\n- \"yesterday\" -> 2024-01-14 (high confidence)\n- \"in two
        weeks\" -> 2024-01-29 (from reference date) or could mean 2024-01-28 (from
        yesterday). I''ll interpret as approximately 2 weeks from reference date.\n\nStructure
        requirements:\n- Must return ONLY JSON\n- No hallucination\n- Include raw_text

        details provided regarding purpose of visits.\"\n}\n\nWait, I should check
        the visit_type logic more carefully. The patient \"was seen yesterday\" -
        this implies the current note is being written on the reference date (2024-01-15)
        about a visit that happened yesterday. The patient \"will return in two weeks\"
        from now. So this appears to be documenting a past visit and scheduling a
        future one, or this could be the provider speaking about the patient''s care
        plan.\n\nActually, looking at it again: \"Patient was seen yesterday and will
        return in two weeks.\" This is likely the clinician dictating about the patient''s
        schedule. The visit_type should probably be \"follow-up\" because the patient
        is returning, but actually, the current note might be about the visit yesterday?
        No, the transcript doesn''t specify what kind of visit yesterday was.\n\nGiven
        the ambiguity, I''ll keep confidence at 0.6-0.7 for visit_type.\n\nAlso, I
        need to make sure I don''t include any markdown formatting since the user
        said \"Return ONLY a JSON object\". So I should output raw JSON without ```json
        markers.\n\nLet me verify all fields:\n- patient_name: null (correct)\n- patient_age:

        is a follow-up plan)\n- confidence: 0.6 (somewhat ambiguous if this is the

        field description: \"follow-up instructions or null\". The text \"will return
        in two weeks\" is the instruction/plan.\n\nOne final check: The user asked
        for \"exact text from transcript\" in various fields. So for temporal_expressions[0].text,
        it should be \"yesterday\". For [1].text, it should be \"in two weeks\".\n\nFor
        follow_up, should I put the raw text or a description? The field description
        says \"follow-up instructions or null\", so I can summarize it, but typically
        I''d put the relevant instruction.\n\nLet me refine the confidence scores:\n-
        visit_type: 0.6 (inferred, not explicit)\n- temporal \"yesterday\": 0.95 (very
        clear relative to reference date)\n- temporal \"two weeks\": 0.8 (clear relative
        time, but absolute date depends on whether it''s from now or from yesterday,
